# Mitch's Rare Treasures

Mitch has gone into business! 

After taking offence to a remark about his business acumen, he has charged headlong into establishing a network of antiques shops around the country. His jealous former colleagues have tried to follow him into the already crowded field, and now it's time for him to do a little market research. You have to help.

Your first task of the day is to use Mitch's premade `fetch-dev-data` script to populate your dev-data directory. 

Mitch was going to enter this data by hand, but it was getting a little tiresome. Help him out by creating a **seed** function for the batch insertion of data using `knex`. The insertion should maintain the current relationships in the data, and ensure things happen in the right order. These are big files, and there may be a more optimal way to insert the data than the simple `insert` method...

As more than a mere hobbyist, Mitch needs to know lots of information about everything in this newly formed DB. As such, he'll need an API, with a lot of queries, so he can really know the state of play.


## API

It's essential that each endpoint is tested, including with the queries! It might be worth using a very small dataset (you can use the data in your `test-setup.sql` file!). You certainly don't want to rely on the randomness of that fetch-dev-data function...

**GET**

## Day-1 -> Advanced

- Add another query to the `/api/treasures` endpoint, which, when set to true, adds a key to your response, specifying the total value of all the treasures .e.g `/api/treasures?show_total_cost=true`

- Add another query to the `/api/shops/:id/treasures` endpoint, which, when set to true, adds a key to your response, specifying the total value of all the treasures in that shop.

- Add another query to the `/api/owners/:id/treasures`, which, when set to true, adds a key to your response, specifying the total value of all the treasures that owner has.

### Very Advanced

- Add another query to the `/api/shops` endpoint, `stock_value` which when set to true, adds a key to each shop specifying the total value of its stock.
- Add two more queries to the `/api/users` endpoint,
  * `shop_count` which when set to true, adds a key specifying the count of all a users' shops.
  * `stock_value` which when set to true, adds a key to each user specifying the total value of all of their stock
